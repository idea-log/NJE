<caption>Boss Tweed</caption>
  <li>I don't care who does the electing, so long as I get to do the nominating.
</li>
<caption>Albert Einstein</caption>

It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.</li>
<li>Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.</li>

  <li>Rich men's jokes are always funny</li>
  <li>We are all wise until we speak.</li>
  <li>The fruits of science are useless.</li>
  <li>everything, except the rule that everything changes, changes.</li>
  <li>Science is the fantasy of the senses, philosophy is the fantasy of the mind, and mysticism is the fantasy of the heart.</li>
  <li>Look at the things you hate. They are usually the things that you don't have.</li>
  <li>The mark of a mature man is swearing as much as he can and his passionate eyes;</li>
  <li>the mark of a wise man is talking as little as he can and his exhausted eyes</li>
  <li>A man is mature inasmuch as he swears!</li>
  <li>A man is wise insofar as he keeps quiet.</li>
  <li>The priests try to control people through their spirits, the doctors through ilnesses, lawyers by destiny, government officials through bureaucracy, teachers through education, tyrants through political power, police and army through physical power, and everyone in one way or another, try to exert their power while putting manacles on others.
</li>
  <li>Music is re-creation, it is a creative exercise. Creativity and good composition pleases. It represents culture, and it is a very important indicator of sophistication along with other aesthetic creative endeavors such as architecture.
</li>
  <li>Music is the exercise of creation. Those who are not involved in arts and creation will let their creativity dwindle.
</li>
  <li>The attempt to create artificial intelligence without all the necessary ingredients and the right processes is like trying to fry dry pasta in a saucepan.
</li>
  <li>You are what you make of yourself, 
  and what you make of yourself determines, 
  to some extent, what you will make of yourself.
</li>
  <li>Implications make life convoluted.
</li>
  <li>God is not important for me because I am not important for God.</li>
  <li>Vibrations, energy, music, reverberation and resonance. There are some people with whom you can establish resonance only if they are in a relevant frequency to yours. A person has various vibrations which are picked up by others. Just like smells. 
</li>
  <li>Logic imprisons humor
</li>
  <li>To put yourself in others' shoes (i.e. to empathize), the first thing you need to do is to remove your shoes
</li>
  <li>The problem of good deeds is that they are not as much reciprocal as evil deeds are.
</li>
  <li>Dating and engagement are trials, and marriage is "The Full Version" so you have to pay for it.
</li>
  <li>War must be good and useful, otherwise the intelligent humankind would have had already put an end to it. 
</li>
  <li>The more reasonable someone is the less capacity someone has for making decisions; and the less reasonable someone is, the more likely someone is to make decisions -good or bad.
</li>
  <li>There isn't much you can do with uncultivated people, you can either have your right to remain silent and distant or ridicule. 
</li>
  <li>(how to deal with folly, or not to deal with folly)
</li>
  <li>If you want to be happy, underestimate life.
</li>
  <li>If people say "You are right." It usually means, "I'm tired of talking about this."
</li>
  <li>Life gets even less tolerable when you understand how intolerable it is.
</li>
<li>Everybody loves their own version of common sense.
</li>
<li>Prejudices are useful, it is the stereo-types that are bad. Had it not been for pre-judices, you wouldn't even be able to cross the street. Prejudices are inductive inferences about the world.
</li>
<li>Everyone deserves the best of everything. No one gets what they deserve: either those who deserve don't get it, or those who don't deserve have it in abundence. What is to deserve anyway? It presupposes free will and that we are responsible for our actions. We are not responsible for our actions. No one can judge me: neither any individual, nor society, nor God. 
</li>
<li>Giving myself a name means: "I do not care for your reality, and what you think is real. You cannot control me, and I don't care what it says on my passport"
</li>
<li>Justice is an illusion and once you stop complaining about the injustices in the world, you can get down to taking action.
</li>
<li>Justice is the cohesive illusion that keeps the society together, and some must go to prison and be punished for other people's belief in justice to be satisfied, whether they are guilty or not. Laws and religion are there to keep us believe in some kind of justice and live together.
</li>
<li>Judging others is the complete absence of sympathy and the full exercise of arrogance.
</li>
<li>Quantity is not a justification of being right. A charlatain may as well have a lot of followers but this makes him nonethebetter. These populist tendencies are a menacing result of the head-counting practice of democracy which make people believe that if something is popular, it must be good. As an elitist and a meritocratist or at least an anarchist I loathe the majority rule, and believe that majority of the people are ignorant and not capable of making sound decisions. The new opium of the west is democracy which they export to stupify nations. When people come together their intelligence does not increase -- just the opposite: they get down to the average common denominator.
</li>
<li>Forex is basically gambling, and it is gambling with other people's money without their consent.
</li>
<li>Create a problem, create a solution, get the all the credit.
</li>
<li>Reality can be measured by number: the number of people who believe in it.
</li>
<li>Is there any meaning to life other than what we attribute to it?
</li>
<li>"We are proud of the harm and disturbance we cause." disrespectfully yours -automobiles and their arrogant drivers
</li>
<li>Bureaucracy is proof either of the absence of God, or the dominance of Satan. 
</li>
<li>The most common denominator is most frequently the lowest common denominator; this is the core problem of populist approaches.
</li>
<li>You can't live in this world in sanity, unless you are already insane. 
</li>
<li>Any theory is coherent until it is disproven.
</li>

Relating to Descartes, a famous philosopher, author of the celebrated dictum, _Cogito ergo sum_ — whereby he was pleased to suppose he demonstrated the reality of human existence. The dictum might be improved, however, thus: _Cogito cogito ergo cogito sum_ — “I think that I think, therefore I think that I am;” as close an approach to certainty as any philosopher has yet made.<br>

<cite> –ESOTERIC</cite>, adj. <br>
Very particularly abstruse and consummately occult.

It is the latter that have most profoundly affected modern thought and found greatest acceptance in our time.<br>
<cite> –EXCEPTION</cite>, n. <br>
A thing which takes the liberty to differ from other things of its class, as an honest man, a truthful woman, etc. “The exception proves the rule” is an expression constantly upon the lips of the ignorant, who parrot it from one another with never a thought of its absurdity. In the Latin, “_Exceptio probat regulam_” means that the exception _tests_ the rule, puts it to the proof, not _confirms_ it. The malefactor who drew the meaning from this excellent dictum and substituted a contrary one of his own exerted an evil power which appears to be immortal.<br>

<cite> -GRAMMAR</cite>, n. <br>

<cite> -GRAVITATION</cite>, n. <br>
The tendency of all bodies to approach one another with a strength proportion to the quantity of matter they contain — the quantity of matter they contain being ascertained by the strength of their tendency to approach one another. This is a lovely and edifying illustration of how science, having made A the proof of B, makes B the proof of A.<br>
<cite> -HOSTILITY</cite>, n. <br>
A peculiarly sharp and specially applied sense of the earth’s overpopulation. Hostility is classified as active and passive; as (respectively) the feeling of a woman for her female friends, and that which she entertains for all the rest of her sex.<br>
<cite> -HOUSELESS</cite>, adj. <br>
Having paid all taxes on household goods.<br>
<cite> -IDIOT</cite>, n. <br>
A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in human affairs has always been dominant and controlling.

<cite> –IMPIETY</cite>, n. <br>
Your irreverence toward my deity.<br>
<cite> –IMPUNITY</cite>, n. <br>Wealth.<br>
<cite> –INADMISSIBLE</cite>, adj. <br>
Not competent to be considered. Said of certain kinds of testimony which juries are supposed to be unfit to be entrusted with, and which judges, therefore, rule out, even of proceedings before themselves alone. Hearsay evidence is inadmissible because the person quoted was unsworn and is not before the court for examination; yet most momentous actions, military, political, commercial and of every other kind, are daily undertaken on hearsay evidence. There is no religion in the world that has any other basis than hearsay evidence. Revelation is hearsay evidence; that the Scriptures are the word of God we have only the testimony of men long dead whose identity is not clearly established and who are not known to have been sworn in any sense. Under the rules of evidence as they now exist in this country, no single assertion in the Bible has in its support any evidence admissible in a court of law.<br>
It cannot be proved that the battle of Blenheim ever was fought, that there was such as person as Julius Caesar, such an empire as Assyria.<br>
But as records of courts of justice are admissible, it can easily be proved that powerful and malevolent magicians once existed and were a scourge to mankind. The evidence (including confession) upon which certain women were convicted of witchcraft and executed was without a flaw; it is still unimpeachable. The judges’ decisions based on it were sound in logic and in law. Nothing in any existing court was ever more thoroughly proved than the charges of witchcraft and sorcery for which so many suffered death. If there were no witches, human testimony and human reason are alike destitute of value.<br>
<cite> –PLEASE</cite>, v. <br>
To lay the foundation for a superstructure of imposition<br>
<cite> –PLEBISCITE</cite>, n. <br>
A popular vote to ascertain the will of the sovereign.<br>
<cite> –PLEONASM</cite>, n. <br>
An army of words escorting a corporal of thought.<br>
<cite> –POLITENESS</cite>, n. <br>
The most acceptable hypocrisy.<br>
<cite> –POSITIVISM</cite>, n. <br>
A philosophy that denies our knowledge of the Real and affirms our ignorance of the Apparent. Its longest exponent is Comte, its broadest Mill and its thickest Spencer.<br>
<cite> –PREJUDICE</cite>, n. <br>
A vagrant opinion without visible means of support.<br>
<cite> –REFERENDUM</cite>, n. <br>
A law for submission of proposed legislation to a popular vote to learn the nonsensus of public opinion.<br>
<cite> –REFLECTION</cite>, n. <br>
An action of the mind whereby we obtain a clearer view of our relation to the things of yesterday and are able to avoid the perils that we shall not again encounter.<br>
(history is a reflection on retrospection, we need to try to understand that fable to see where we are now, and reflect on the issues of the present.)<br>
<cite> –REPUBLIC</cite>, n. <br>
A nation in which, the thing governing and the thing governed being the same, there is only a permitted authority to enforce an optional obedience. In a republic, the foundation of public order is the ever lessening habit of submission inherited from ancestors who, being truly governed, submitted because they had to. There are as many kinds of republics as there are graduations between the despotism whence they came and the anarchy whither they lead.
<br>
<cite> —RESIDENT</cite>, adj. <br>
Unable to leave.<br>
<cite> –PRICE</cite>, n. <br>
Value, plus a reasonable sum for the wear and tear of conscience in demanding it.<br>

Insults:
You suffer delusions of adequacy. You are a living testimony to evolution. You are an experiment in Artificial Stupidity.. You are you. You have nothing under your hat but your hair You are a few clowns short of a circus. You have the brains of a worm and half its looks. You would need to study to become a half-wit. You've reached your apex and still can't see over the wall.
Ab abusu ad usum non valet consequentia. The consequences of abuse do not apply to general use (rights abused by some are still rights).
