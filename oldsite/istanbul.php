  <h1 class="text-center">A Personal Istanbul Guide</h1>

  <p>The best thing to do with an advice is to pass it onto others as Oscar Wilde said. <br>
  <img src="../images/istanbul-map.jpg">
    <ul>
    <caption>Transportation:</caption>
      <li>Get yourself an Istanbul Card even if you will stay for only one day. It is much cheaper that way. </li>
      <li>Also, get yourself a museum card for 80 liras(June, 2017) instead of paying 40 liras for Hagia Sophia alone. You will probably want to visit more than 2 places. Unless you only wish to see Hagia Sophia, you need a museum card. Unfortunately a few places are not included in the card such as the beautiful cisterns. </li><br>
    </ul>

    <ul>
     <caption>Old Town</caption>
     <li><a href="http://www.byzantium1200.com/hipodrom.html">Hippodrome Area</a> which includes the German fountain, Obelisk of Thutmose III, the walled obelisk, and the serpent column. Futhermore is the Sultanahmet Mosque and Arasta Bazaar.</li>
      <li>Haghia Sophia (usually crowded, Entrance fee ~40 liras</li>
      <li>Cisterns (Yerebatan Sarnıcı) ~20TL</li>
      <li>Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmed Cami)</li>
      <li>Topkapı Palace: Takes time to go through it and there may be huge lines.</li>
      <li>Gülhane Park (The House of Roses): includes the Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar library, and you should also drink some tea on the upper end of the park while watching the sea, Avoid if on a low budget since the prices are three times more expensive compared to tea prices elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Archaeology Museum, takes time and research to get the best of it.</li>

    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Student life in Istanbul:<br>
  Visiting galleries and museums is a must.<br>
  Boshporus university has a great cinema hall where they show select movies that you will not be able to find on regular cinema halls. <br>

  <a href="https://www.theistanbulinsider.com/top-10-outdoor-cafes-in-istanbul/" target="_blank">Outdoor cafes</a>

  <ul><caption>For the Adventurist&amp;Nature lover</caption>
    <li>Going to the Prince islands will give you the 1 hour sea-ride for a bus ticket's price. You can swim, rent a bike, or visit the church on top of the hill in Büyükada</li>
    <li>Belgrade forest offers a wonderful escape from this stressful city if you have been here for a while and are tired. </li>

  </ul>

  For the Gourmet<br>

  There are various cuisines in Istanbul, but of course you should first try the famous Turkish cuisine. <br>

      <li>Türk Alman bookshop/coffeehouse: This is a very tightly packed and cool place where people study. A lot of the people here are interested in the German language and culture.

      Bahariye çikolatacısı(moda)

  Balat Area:<br>
  Eastern Roman Patriarchate is a must see in this area. There are a lot of cute local cafes here. Pick at random.<br>

  Haliç Area:<br>
  Pierre Loti is a famous location here. The Teleferic takes you up, and on the way back you may walk down from the cemetery to the banks of Golden horn where you can rent a boat for around ~25 liras to get to the other side of Golden horn where you can eat "uykuluk" which is similar to "kokoreç" in taste.<br>

  Süleymaniye Area:<br>
  There are many restaurants just next to the Süleymaniye mosque. It is cheap, tasty, and local. There is restaurant called Dar-uz Ziyafe which is a historically sited restaurant with good soups and food. 
  <br>

  Unkapanı area:<br>
  There is a local place for their rice and chicken. it is very cheap and tasty too. It is a local experience I would suggest you to experience. From there, you can walk inwards and get to "Vefa Bozacısı" which is the original place of the old Ottoman drink of Boza. It is a drink made of millets and topped up with cinnamon. You can also find other juices such as Şıra and "Osmanlı Şerbeti". If you like the interesting sweet-sour taste, you can buy yourself a big bottle and take home.<br>

  Samatya Area:<br>
  35C Buses from Taksim will take you to Kocamustafapaşa from where you can just walk downhill for 200 meters to get to an old district called Samatya which gets its name from the Greek word Psamathion (sandy). This is one of the classic locations for Rakı-Balık the Turkish Vodka. Rakia - connecting people. Meze, which is the general name for some various light food to accompany rakı, are an absolutely great treat. There is also a place called "Helena" that opened some months ago in what used to be an ancient blacksmith and is not serving as an extra-ordinary restaurant. <br>

  Seatime:<br>
  There are some beautiful coastlines where walking is especially enjoyable such as Ortaköy-Bebek-Tarabya coast, and Kuzguncuk.<br>

  <blockquote>
    Bebek Kahvesi — This café is a basic yet pleasant place for a typical Turkish breakfast, a tea or a coffee. It is located next to the ferry, adjacent to the cute Bebek park.
    Bebek Badem Ezmecisi — This is simply the place to be if you’re looking for the best marzipan in Istanbul. The shop has been selling marzipan, an almond paste sweet, since 1904.
    Midnight Express — a great concept store, founded because of the desire of an architect and a fashion designer to create a boutique that reflected their common interests. (midnightexpress.com.tr)
    Lucca — It is a small modern café-bistro-bar. Its convenient location, award-winning cocktails and wide variety of food served any time of the day make it one of Bebek’s favorite establishments. (luccastyle.com)
    Bosphorus Walk — Start in Bebek and walk all the way to the Europe Fortress (Rumeli Hisarı).

      </blockquote>

  Expats:<br>
  Going to the forest at the weekend for a relaxing time with sports, clean air and perhaps some picnic, is a great idea. You can get there from Yenikapı-Hacıosman(~40 minutes) Metro and by using the bus(~20 minutes) number:<!--The number of the bus goes in here-->. <br>

  Love Sports?<br>
  Rundamental, Nike, Adidas, Balkaymak Runners and Walkers Freelethics and others are arranging social sports activities where you can go running together for an extra motivational boost if you don't like running alone, or like challenges. <br>

  Unfortunately Istanbul is not a good place to ride a bike. I have been unfortunate to have my bike stolen after 2 weeks of buying it. There are not many safe roads for riding a bike either except a few coastal lines. So riding a bike is not recommended. <br>

  Traffic they say?<br>
  Traffic is a serious problem in a congested and chaotic city without proper planning. There aren't many parking spaces for god damn cars and many of them find the solution in obstructing the sidewalks and double parking. Careless, agressive, selfish, and noisy drivers form the bulk of the traffic. They don't show much reverence to pedestrians, so beware when crossing the streets. J-walking is also pretty common, but even if you are going to do it, make sure that you do it safely.  <br>  

  A personal Account of Istanbul:<br>
  Where did this name come from anyways?<br>


  This is a gigantic city which has grown in size tremendously in the past few decades since most of the job opportunities and business networks are located here. With flexible regulations, lack of prohibitions and planning, Istanbul became a gigantic monstrous city.

SuAda — This nightclub actually plays in a league of their own, since SuAda is not located by the Bosphorus … but on an island in it!

Serkis Kalfa built a three-storey mansion on the island and lived there until he died in 1899. After World War I the island was rented and used as a coal storehouse. In 1957 Galatasaray Sports Club bought the island and transformed it into a social facility.

FISH RESTAURANTS

Balıkçı Kahraman

Balıkçı Kahraman fish restaurant by the Black Sea in Istanbul, Turkey.
© Photo by Balıkçı Kahraman
The restaurant is named after its owner, originating from the Black Sea Region. As you can guess, it is a cozy family run restaurant. Serving sea food since the late 90s, this is a favorite place for the ones who prefer taste rather than looks.

The place has a modest decoration, yet they deserve to be less modest when it comes to the sea food, and their varieties of mezes. Grilled turbot is their expertise. The place is preferred by local celebrities, statesmen and famous businessmen.

Daily open from 12:30 p.m. until 10:00 p.m.. Reservation is required and all credit cards are accepted.

Address: İskele cad. No:15, Rumeli Kavağı – Istanbul, Turkey
Telephone: +90 212 242 64 47

Balıkçı Sabahattin

© Photo by Balıkçı Sabahattin
The restaurant takes its name from the owner, Fisherman Sabahattin. He comes from a family in Mudanya, a town in Bursa located by the Sea of Marmara. His family knows, loves and respects both the sea and the sea food. He took over the business from his father, and now his sons also work with him. The restaurant is located in a historic building constructed in 1927. This is not a restaurant to go for neither the view nor chic. This restaurant is a real fine example of serving delicious sea food to local families.

Open from noon to midnight every day of the week. Reservation is required, and I recommend a table in the garden. If you are in the area and do not have a reservation, you can still go and wait a bit. I’m sure they will help you. All credit cards are accepted.

Address: Cankurtaran Mahallesi, Seyit Hasan Kuyu Sok No: 1, Sultanahmet – Istanbul, Turkey

Vegetable or Zeytin Yağlı Dishes

Turks have a big diversity of vegetables and of course this reflects on the dishes. One very important detail about vegetable dishes is whether they have meat in them or not. If a dish is cooked without any kind of meat then it is called zeytin yağlı — meaning cooked with olive oil. These kind of vegetable dishes are mostly served cold. Here are three good examples of zeytin yağlı dishes:

Yaprak Sarma — Wrapped vine leaves with a filling of rice, onion and spices like mint, currant, pepper and cinnamon.
Dolma — Vegetables either fresh or dried eggplants, peppers, tomatoes or zucchinis are stuffed with a mixture of rice and onion with various spices.
Taze Fasulye — Green beans cooked with tomato and/or tomato paste and of course onion.
Since Turks love meat very much, almost all the zeytin yağlı dishes are cooked with meat, too. But that’s not it. There are many other delicious meat dishes to discover.

Turkish Dishes with Meat

Karnıyarık — Fried eggplants with a minced meat, onion, parsley, garlic and tomato filling. This dish is a must. To make sure that what you get is a good one, check the eggplants. The dark color of the peel should not smudge on the peeled parts and the meat should not look too dark or dry.
Lahmacun — A pizza like dish with a topping of finely minced meat and onions with spices on flaky thin dough. It is served with tomatoes, lettuce, parsley or rocket and most people prefer to squeeze lemon on it and roll to eat easier like tacos. It originates from the early Syrian cuisine of the Levant and the name comes from Arabic “dough with meat”. It has been a popular fast food like dish in Turkey.
Kurufasulye — Beans, Turks just love it. It can be cooked with or without meat or even with dried spiced thin slices of beef called pastırma. Served with sade pilav (plain rice) and turşu (pickles and sauerkraut). The restaurants across Süleymaniye Mosque are the masters of this dish.
Best Known Dishes and Masterpieces of the Turkish Cuisine

Kebaps — Kebap is the common name for a dish where meat is coated around a skewer and grilled over a charcoal fire. Originally the meat consisted of lamb or beef, but nowadays you can also chose chicken. What Kebap To Eat While Visiting Istanbul is a full page dedicated to this mouth watering dish.
Döner –In essence it is a dish of beaten pieces of meat seasoned with suet, local herbs and spices, skewered on a spit and grilled vertically. Check out this page if you want to know your döner kebap history and selected dishes.
Köfte — It is commonly referred to as meatballs, but they come in all shapes. The köfte basics are ground meat (usually lamb or mutton) mixed with crumbled bread, minced onions and spices. The most common dish is Izgara Köfte, where the meat mixture is grilled and served with grilled green peppers, chopped parsley, crumbled dried red peppers and rice or bread on the side.
Mantı – You could think of mantı as some kind of dumplings. This excellent Turkish dish contains two main ingredients: the dough and the filling, which consists of grounded beef or lamb, onion, salt and pepper. Find out why good handmade mantı is so much more than just Turkish ravioli with yoghurt.
Popular Turkish Side Dishes

Pilav — There is a great variety of pilaf in the Turkish cuisine, yet the easiest one to make is the most favorite and available one: sade pilav. It is plain rice cooked in water with butter/vegetable oil and noodle like small pasta pieces – şehriye. Varieties are rice cooked with eggplants, chickpeas, meat or liver slices; and of course spices like cinnamon, pepper, thyme, cumin and even almonds.
Bulgur Pilavı – this side dish looks like rice but is actually wheat. The most common type is cooked with roasted onions, green peppers, tomato paste and mint. One of my favorites.
Fried vegetables — Fried eggplants, green peppers, and zucchini with tomato sauce or yogurt are one of the best treats. According to your liking garlic is always welcomed with the sauce or in the yogurt.
Mücver — The main ingredients of this popular Turkish dish are shredded zucchini, eggs and flour. A very common cooking preference adds white cheese, green onions and mint. It is lightly fried in vegetable or olive oil, and served hot as a side dish.
Cacık — A very refreshing mixture of grinded or shredded cucumbers with diluted yogurt, garlic and mint. On a hot summers day some serve it with some ice cubes in it, to make it even more refreshing.
Most restaurants on Istiklal Caddesi serving hot food display the available dishes. So if your stomach gets upset easily, take a peek at the food and try to stay clear of the too oily or spicy looking ones.

Afiyet Olsun!



Is the Asian Side of Istanbul Worth Visiting – Part 1

Yes, it is. But only if you’re in Istanbul for 4 days or more, or visiting this gorgeous Turkish metropolitan for the second time. Let’s not beat around the bush, with the huge concentration of (historical) sightseeing spots on the European side of Istanbul, the Asian shore is playing second fiddle to its European counterpart.

If you already have this ‘been there, done that’ feeling, then the Asian part offers a view of Istanbul and its inhabitants not found in Sultanahmet or Taksim. The best way to start exploring the Asian side of Istanbul is by taking a ferry to Kadıköy. Here are my favorite spots worth paying a visit in the different Istanbul!

Kadıköy Tuesday Market

If you happen to be in town on a Tuesday or Friday, the famous Tuesday market is a remarkable spot for an adventure in the local market. Starting from 1969 the market place in Kadıköy was the sanctuary of the local shoppers. Naturally it grew with the city and the population. Finally in 2008 it moved from its traditional place in Altıyol to a modern forty thousand square meters area, with four thousand stalls and a car park in Fikirtepe.

Some of the locals still miss the historic market despite the (traffic) chaos it created. They say the new one does not have the same ambience. Yet some are really happy with the spacious new spot.

You can simply take a taxi to the market place which is about 3 km away from the ferry dock. Alternatively you can take a bus from Kadıköy, 8A and get off at Mandıra Caddesi or Ş.Er Bülent Altınsoy station. You can walk too, but keep in mind that it is uphill most of the time.
