  <h3 class="text-center">Istanbul Tour Guide</h3>
  <p>I have started learning more and more about Istanbul since I came here on the 21sth of February 2016. After taking some foreign friends around, I decided I would make a comprehensive guide about Istanbul. Considering the richness of its history and the sheer size of it, it is not an easy feet to accomplish, but I am learning more and more about it day by day. I can give you a very pleasant and satisfying tour of the city taking you to places where you would otherwise not have known. My <a href="istanbul.php">Istanbul Guide</a> is still a stub, but will be growing in time as I find more time managing it.</p>

They behave with their gut feelings and are so deaf and blind. They behave like zombies. There are so many zombie movies, but actually most humans are like zombies. They are like leeches that suck out your blood and nerves.</p>

                  <p>I would like to live in a city which is not crowded, ideally somewhere between 50.000-500.000 people. The less the better! I would like to live among kind and harmless people who respect each other. I want to live in a place where there will not be political turmoil or economic problems. I want to live in a place without poor people, where everyone takes care of everyone else, and where there isn't a huge gap between the rich and the poor, where everyone has their basic needs to live in dignity. <br>
                  The nature should be all around and clean, and the air fresh. I don't want to live in a city where cars keep roaming day and night making all kinds of noise. There should also be places for social gathering where people can get to speak cordially and be able to trust the other people.<br>
                  The law, if it should be necessary at all, is there to punish the wrongdoers instead of protecting power and property.The media in that city should be free from any kind of coercion and should write about good and valuable things. There would be free and enjoyable schools, and healthcare should be free and available to everyone as well.<br>
                  After all, if the state gathers taxes these are the right places wherein that money could be spent, i.e. for the benefit of the people in that city, and not to fill the pockets of the few corrupted politicians and traders. Transportation should be very simple in that place, and it would be for free.<br>
                  Also the city should be beautiful itself. The buildings and city environs should appeal to the eye, and there should be a nice smooth transition from city to nature. They should be embedded in each other. The city should be integrated in nature and nature should be integrated in the city. The city shouldn't give you the impression that it is apart from the nature that surrounds it. The buildings should have style and beauty. That it was a planned settlement should be obvious rather than just people accidentally coming together.
