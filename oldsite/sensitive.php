<p
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?<br> 
She sells sea shells at the sea shore, the shells she sells are the sea-shore shells, I'm sure.<br>
William always wears a very warm woolen vest in winter. Victor, however, will never wear woolen underwear even in the Wild Wild West.<br>
Can you imagine an imaginary menagerie manager managing an imaginary menagerie?<br>

<p>​Kamasutra says: If you suck one nipple, the women herself offers the other one. And that was the origin of "buy one get one free"!<br>

Did you ever notice: everything on a woman's upper body starts with a "B". Blouse, Bra, Bikini, Boobs and lower body with a "P" Peticoat, panties, pussy... That's origin of "BP"!<br>

Before sex, you help each other get naked. After sex, you dress only yourself. Moral: In life no one helps you once you're fucked.<br>

Success is like pregnancy. Everybody congratulates you but nobody knows how many times you got fucked to achieve it.<br>

What is the difference between frustration and satisfaction? What the Fuck! and What a Fuck!​​<br>

3 people having sex is a threesome, 2 is a twosome. So next time someone calls you 'HANDSOME', don't take it as a compliment!<br>

Life is like a dick, sometimes it becomes hard for no reason.<br>

Practical thought: A husband is supposed to make his wife's panties wet, not her eyes. A wife is supposed to make her husband's dick hard, not his life..!
<br>
When a lady is pregnant, all her friends touch her stomach ad say "Congrats!".<br>
But none of them come and touch the man's Penis and say "Well done!".<br>
Moral: Hard work is never appreciated: Only result matters.<br>
